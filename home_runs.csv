'I had a homer and a double,' explained Robby, 'drove in one run, scored another and made a catch that robbed (Eddie) Mathews of an extra-base hit. We won the second game 4-0. I won the fight.' Interesting logic? Maybe so. But it is the kind of thinking that has made Frank Robinson one of the most startling men in baseball and a nostalgic carry-back to the old days of the game — the days of hard hitting and harder fielding, of bench sniping, occasional brawls and plain old cussedness. Robinson has variously been called a sorehead, a sadist and a 'black Ty Cobb.' He has been dismissed as a loafer and criticized as a viciously agressive player. Says Robinson himself, in phrases reminisecent of Cobb: 'I am not a fancy guy, not a glamour boy. I don't believe I intrigue the fans and obviously I don't interest the sportswriters.

Strange as it is to say in the glow of all his glory, but there was a time when Al Kaline wasn't a very pleasant person to be around. He threw helmets. He threw bats. He threw tantrums. It wasn't easy moving into such a fast-paced world when you grew up in the Westport section of Baltimore, where the fields were made of dirt and only dirt and the whole world was northing more than row houses upon row houses upon row houses. By the time he was 18, he was in the major leagues. By the time he was 20, he was the American League batting champion, the youngest in history. Younger than even Ty Cobb. What did he know?

The strong-armed right fielder spent most of that time placing a distant third in the Red Sox outfield to sluggers Jim Rice and Fred Lynn, who experienced immediate success when they arrived in Boston in 1975. However, a new batting stance and a different approach at the plate helped Evans eventually evolve into one of the American League's most potent batsmen and finest all-around players.

Two years earlier he had signed with the Phillies as a free agent. We were teammates for three seasons.

In four games, I batted .429, hit three home runs, drove in eight runs, and was named Most Valuable Player of the NLCS. That's when Pete dubbed me with the nickname 'Sarge' and said, 'Any time a future Hall of Famer gives you a nickname, it sticks.' Pete got one part right. It's been two decades, and to everybody in baseball (and many outside of it) I'm still known as Sarge, and the name has given me an identity, an image, and a legacy.

While these men might have exceeded his raw total, it is doubtful that any of them hit home runs harder or farther than Post, the pride of St. Henry, Ohio. Post was often described as the 'best dressed Red' thanks to all of the free suits he acquired by virtue of his long home runs that hit the famous Hit Sign Win Suit billboard located atop the The Laundry building that loomed across the street from Crosley Field's left field wall. It is also believed that Post may have hit one of the longest home runs ever when he smashed a ball off the scoreboard clock at old Busch Stadium in St. Louis in 1961. Many longtime baseball observers who saw the shot described it as the longest they had ever witnessed. Post's teammate, Jay Hook, an erstwhile engineering student, calculated the distance the ball would have traveled if its flight had not been interrupted by the clock and concluded that the ball would have come to rest some 569 feet from its point of departure. Then there was the time in 1957 that Post, in batting practice, sent a ball through the new scoreboard at Crosley Field just as the scoreboard's designer was touting its indestructibility to Reds General Manager Gabe Paul."" - Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

In other words, for a salvage operation of a team that would lead the league in wins and baggage, Pierzynski was a perfect fit. That Captain Chaos found a sweet home in Chicago was never more apparent than during the ALCS against the Los Angeles Angels. Pierzynski made possible both the series-changing run in Game 2 and the series-clinching run in Game 5 as only he can: by somehow reaching base twice on plays on which he was thought to be called out. You can look it up in your Polish-American dictionary: The Angels got Pierzynskied. 'Even when I don't do anything, I do something,' Pierzynski said last Thursday.

Trammell would spend 20 years with the Tigers, and while he didn't reach 3,000 hits like Yount (who eventually moved to centerfield and won another MVP Award) or Ripken (who also won a second MVP before moving to third base for his final few years), he did make six All-Star teams and win four Gold Gloves in his career, even while competing for attention with the other two."" - Jaffe, Jay.

Agee was only 58, which made the news all the more unbearable. Although Agee played only a handful of his 12 seasons with the Mets and didn't start or finish his career with the franchise, he became a lasting symbol of the team's unexpected success in 1969. Displaying his vintage Gold Glove defense against the Baltimore Orioles, Agee made two acrobatic catches for the Mets in Game 3 of the 1969 World Series. The pair of catches helped the Mets win the game and take a two games-to-one lead in the Series. And let's not forget what Agee did during the regular season in 1969, when he hit a career-high 26 home runs as the team's everyday center fielder."" - Markusen, Bruce. Author.

When I came out of the war (WWII), I was 24 years old, which was a little late to be trying to start a career in professional baseball. A friend of mine and I managed to talk our way into a tryout in spring training with the old Oklahoma team in the Pacific Coast League. In those days, the Pacific Coast League was a first class league, with lots of good ballplayers, many of whom went on to play in the majors. Stengel was the manager at Oakland and he did everything he could to discourage us. He assigned both of us to the 'B' squad, which meant that we worked out on a separate field, with none of the amenities that the 'A' squad enjoyed. We had rocks on the field, no drinking fountain, and worked out with used balls. It was miserable. Every once in awhile we would sneak into the 'A' squad batting practice — just so we could hit some decent balls — and he would always chase us back to the 'B' squad field. We were working our asses off trying to get him to notice us, but really felt we didn't have much of a chance, since he spent all his time with the 'A' squad. The day before we broke camp to go north, Stengel called us into his office and said, 'I know you guys have been working hard and I'm taking you both with me on the main roster. I'll pay you $400 a month and travel expense.' I was thrilled to death, but I told him I'd have to have $450 or I was going home! And you know what? He gave it to me! The thing about Stengel was: he made me work on my game at all times and taught me how rewarding it could be to work hard. He really knew the basics of the game, positioning, hitting, the cutoff man, bunting, and alert and intelligent base running. Lots of people think of him as a crackpot, but the man really knew his baseball."" - Wally Westlake (Heyde, Jack. Trafford Publishing.

957,957,Freddie Lindstrom,lindsfr01,103,"""Freddie Lindstrom was a Hall of Fame third baseman and outfielder who primarily played for the New York Giants. He played in World Series on both ends of his 13-year career, in 1924 and again in 1935. Between those, he reached up some very impressive numbers: seven times, he topped .300, including a career-high .379 in 1930. In addition to his hitting accomplishments, he was considered one of the best third baseman of his time. A foot injury in 1931 led to a position switch to the outfield, where he continued to excel. The Hall of Fame came calling in 1972, a just reward for an outstanding career. He finished with 1,747 hits in 5,611 at-bats, good for a .311 clip. That still doesn't come close to his son's lifetime average however.

Watching college baseball today, I don’t think some schools are getting kids ready for the big leagues.
