# top-home-run-hitters
A collection of data about the top home-run hitters in MLB history.

This data collection was inspired by the questions: What does the current leaderboard of home-runs in the MLB look like? How does the handedness and the attended college affect the number of home-runs these players have hit throughout their careers?

The data in this repository was scraped from the web and the link to the webpage can be found here:

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook which will run through the website to collect information about the players in the leaderboard of home-runs. It also includes a .csv file of the data which has already been scraped and compiled.
