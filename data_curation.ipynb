       " '\"Like ammonia, mace or Simon Cowell, Pierzynski is a chronic irritant. He has been called a jerk, a cancer, a provocateur, various unmentionable body parts and, most recently and affectionately, by his third set of teammates in three years, Captain Chaos. All it took to make him the White Sox catcher was getting run out of San Francisco (costing him about $2 million), spending 10 hours on the phone in candid conversations with wary Chicago general manager Kenny Williams and enduring a talking-to by White Sox announcer and family friend Ken (Hawk) Harrelson. In other words, for a salvage operation of a team that would lead the league in wins and baggage, Pierzynski was a perfect fit. That Captain Chaos found a sweet home in Chicago was never more apparent than during the ALCS against the Los Angeles Angels. Pierzynski made possible both the series-changing run in Game 2 and the series-clinching run in Game 5 as only he can: by somehow reaching base twice on plays on which he was thought to be called out. You can look it up in your Polish-American dictionary: The Angels got Pierzynskied. \\'Even when I don\\'t do anything, I do something,\\' Pierzynski said last Thursday. He channeled the Zen master of catching, Yogi Berra, in more ways than just by uttering mind-bending aphorisms.

       " '\"In the early 1980s, things started to change, as the American League produced a trio of talented two-way shortstops who could field their position and pose a substantial threat to pitchers. The Brewers\\' Robin Yount, who debuted in the majors in 1974 at the tender age of 18, evolved into a top-notch hitter and earned MVP honors in 1982 as Milwaukee won the pennant.

Debuting between those two, in late 1977, was the Tigers\\' Alan Trammell. He didn\\'t win the MVP award in 1984—that honor went to reliever Willie Hernandez, a teammate—but he hit .314/.382/.468 while helping Detroit to a world championship. Trammell would spend 20 years with the Tigers, and while he didn\\'t reach 3,000 hits like Yount (who eventually moved to centerfield and won another MVP Award) or Ripken (who also won a second MVP before moving to third base for his final few years), he did make six All-Star teams and win four Gold Gloves in his career, even while competing for attention with the other two.\" - Jaffe, Jay.

       " '\"Thanks to Rock, I started having more fun at the ballpark. Sometimes he was like a pesky gnat that would fly up and buzz in your ear until you swatted it away. He did things to me that no one else in the Expos clubhouse would have dreamed of doing, including coming up from behind me and delivering a couple quick jabs to my back before running off. My instinct was to give chase, but I realized I wouldn\\'t be able to catch him. Rock wasn\\'t a clown, but he definitely had a real comedian in him. While I became known for my serious and focused approach to the game, Rock wore the joy of baseball (and life) on his sleeve. His carefree personality helped loosen me up. There were many times when I\\'d be sitting in the Expos clubhouse, locked inside myself, not saying much, and Rock would come along and rib me until I relaxed.\" - Hall of Famer Andre Dawson in Rock Solid: My Life in Baseball\\'s Fast Lane (Tim Raines, Triumph Books, Forward Section, 06/01/2017)',\n",

And I really like his brother, [Seattle third baseman] Kyle Seager. And Kyle is an awesome guy. So I didn\\'t really know what to expect about his brother. And then once I got around Corey, I\\'m like \\'Man, it must just run in the family.\\' Because both of those guys are really awesome people, who they are as people, let alone players. And then his demeanor as a player, he\\'s really calm. You don’t see him get too upset too much. He has a confidence about him when he gets out on the field, or out on defense, or even in the locker room, or in the dugout. That\\'s going to be huge, because you’ll be able to talk to him. We\\'re going to make mistakes in this game. And hopefully he\\'ll ask me questions, and I can give him as much info as I possibly can. I\\'m always open to helping guys out. You never know.

In fact, he sat down with (Dave) Trembley this spring and said as much, that he was going to concentrate on hitting and make it tough for the manager to keep him out of the lineup.

Yes, that Bengie Molina. The player that Giants manager Bruce Bochy has diplomatically described as \"not being born with the gift of speed\" first set out to make the majors as the next Ozzie Smith. He had deft hands, a rifle arm and enough speed that he usually hit in the No. 2 hole.

The native of Bay, Arkansas, played his first three years in L.A. in the infamous Coliseum, with its 250-foot left-field wall surmounted by a 40-foot-high screen.

A friend of mine and I managed to talk our way into a tryout in spring training with the old Oklahoma team in the Pacific Coast League. In those days, the Pacific Coast League was a first class league, with lots of good ballplayers, many of whom went on to play in the majors. Stengel was the manager at Oakland and he did everything he could to discourage us. He assigned both of us to the \\'B\\' squad, which meant that we worked out on a separate field, with none of the amenities that the \\'A\\' squad enjoyed. We had rocks on the field, no drinking fountain, and worked out with used balls. It was miserable. Every once in awhile we would sneak into the \\'A\\' squad batting practice — just so we could hit some decent balls — and he would always chase us back to the \\'B\\' squad field. We were working our asses off trying to get him to notice us, but really felt we didn\\'t have much of a chance, since he spent all his time with the \\'A\\' squad. The day before we broke camp to go north, Stengel called us into his office and said, \\'I know you guys have been working hard and I\\'m taking you both with me on the main roster. I\\'ll pay you $400 a month and travel expense.\\' I was thrilled to death, but I told him I\\'d have to have $450 or I was going home! And you know what? He gave it to me! The thing about Stengel was: he made me work on my game at all times and taught me how rewarding it could be to work hard.

       " '\"There is one of the finest men ever to play this game. I\\'ll never forget him, the way he impressed me back in \\'62, when we were at Toronto. Here\\'s a guy who drew down a bunch ($175,000) at signing, but he wasn\\'t one of those guys who let a big bonus ruin him. He was out there early every day. He wanted to learn. He was always trying to find ways to improve himself. He talked to everybody, and he was learning all the time.

       " '\"In high school, I was tall and lanky, and I didn’t think that I was emotionally ready to play professional baseball out of high school in the minors. I opted to go The University of California Berkley, and it was the six-pack then, there were only six teams in the Pac-10 at the time. I got to play shortstop as an 18-year-old freshman, but they wanted me to try switch hitting. In my youthful arrogance, I said yes, I got this, I can do it. I attempted to do it and struggled for a good two to three weeks, and I wanted to take batting practice behind closed doors with no one watching. The ball was not coming off my bat like I wanted, a couple of duck farts into left field, nothing really firm. I was getting destroyed during fall ball against 87 mph fastballs, and I was barely making contact. Two-thirds of the season into fall ball, I was going to tell the coach that I couldn’t switch hit. The coach saw right through what I said and saw a kid who was trying to make an impression on the team and not what would further my career after college. Watching college baseball today, I don’t think some schools are getting kids ready for the big leagues. The coach said you have two options, stop switch hitting and I’ll pull your scholarship, and you go home, or you can continue to switch hit and play baseball with us. I obviously made the right decision, but it helped to know that he had faith in me to push me that way.\" - Geoff Blum (Huysman, Eric.
